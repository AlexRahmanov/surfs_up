# Purpose of this analysis
The purpose of the Surfs Up challenge was to create a connection to a SQLite DB and use sqlalchemy to run queries to attain the summary statistics for the months of June and December. Writing the query then converting the results into a list then finally into a pandas dataframe. 
The summary statistics were printed out for both months ensuring they were matched to what the challenge had.
